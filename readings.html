			<h1>Blog Review</h1>

			<p>After reading the blog, my favorite idea from the list is number twelve(12). Number twelve 				speaks about AI-powered virtual assistance. This idea speaks about how many different types of 				personal assistants. These are personal, customer support, expert and executive assistants. These 			AI assistants at their respective levels would make certain tasks easier and faster for many 				people. They could make life easier for older people and people with learning and physical 				disabilities. It can also make life easier for younger people such as myself by helping with 				research or academic help to a certain limit. <br>
			However, even though it has a lot of benefits it has a good amount of ethical issues. One such 				issue is that these different types of assistants can or will take over the job of some people. 			One such job is customer service assistants. While AI is great it is better to work along side it 			rather than having it completely taking over certain jobs. I believe that there should be people 			working along side the AI incase there are any errors or any need for human assistance. An example 			of an app/website in this category is <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a>.

			<summary>Chapter 4</summary>
			<p>The title of chapter 4 is achieve your goals. In this chapter, Micheal and I learns that to 				achieve one's goals you must write it down. When you write down your goals your mind will 				subconsciously try to make them come true. When setting goals, you don't only set them to achieve 			them, you set them with the intention of changing yourself to make the goal possible. You will not 			be able to accomplish all your goals over night but you can always change the path you go down to 			accomplish it. When setting goals you should break them up into minor and major goals based on 				time frame. If you want to achieve something in a certain amount of time you must set minor goals 			leading up the major goals.
			
			<details>
			<summary>Thoughts</summary>
			<p>I can align the principle of writing down my goals into my life as stated in the chapter. If I 			start writing down the goals that I want to achieve in a short term to long term period, I believe 			that I can achieve them sooner or later.</p>

			<summary>Chapter 5</summary>
			<p>The title of chapter 5 is the proper use of time. Micheal and I learnt that in life we most 			choose between the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. When you set a long- term goal or 				have a big dream, most of the time we don't purse this goal or dream because we fear the failure 			that may arise from it. However, when we are on our death bed, we will feel the crushing pain of 			regret for not trying and at this point it is too late. We as people spend most of our time on 				urgent things just as bills due and forget abut important things such as your goals to improve our 			life. In life if we don't design our own life and continue to allow live to be controlled by 				people, we will not reach far because no one but ourself has our best interest in mind.
			</p>

			
			<details>
			<summary>Thoughts</summary>
			<p>I can use these principles to help me to work on not only  my urgent matter but also my 				important matter such as my goals so that I can be a successful person. I will not wait or be 				dragged between another person because only I know what person I want to become.

			<summary>Chapter 6</summary>
			<p>The title of chapter 6 is surround yourself with the best people. Micheal and I learnt that we 			should surround ourself with good and successful people. This is because the people you around 				have power to influence your destiny. You should be around people who uplift you and make you want 			to achieve more. You need people to motivate you to go higher than you already are. The people 				that you are around influence you in either a negative or positive way. If you are around negative 			influences you will slowly but surely be influenced to do something negative or react in a 				negative manner. Everyone you meet should be put them into three categories. These categories are: 			disassociation, limited association and expanded association. Disassociation is when you stop 				associating or interacting with the person, limited association is when you limit or decrease your 			association or interaction with the person and expanded association is when you expand or increase 			your association or interaction with the person. At this point in our life that some of us are at 			now, it is very hard to attract good and successful company. But the more you work on yourself and 			work toward improvement, you will eventually be successful enough to meet successful people.

			<p>I can use these principles when I am deciding who to spend my time around. I will also evaluate 			the people around me to see if they are there to bring me down or lift me up.

			<summary>Chapter 7</summary>
			<p>The title of chapter 6 is be a life-long learner. Micheal and I learnt that if we want to 				succeed in life you need to continue learning even after formal education. The people who become 			successful are the ones who have self-education. Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is 			all the lessons and knowledge that we receive on our journey while improving and growing. There 			are many ways to learn how to improve your life. Three of these are: reading books, learning from 			successful people by observation and reflecting on life to see what where you went the wrong way 			or right way.
			</p>
			<details>
			<summary>Thoughts</summary>
			<p>I can use these principles by reading more books that will help me improve my life and help me 			to become a successful person. I won't only reply on my formal education.
