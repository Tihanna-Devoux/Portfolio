			<h1 class="center">Stubborn</h1> 
			<p>I am a very stubborn person. For me, being stuubborn affects my home and school life by making 			me unable to give up on any thing. If I have an assignment or task to complete, I will absolutely 			do it because I refuse to fail at anything.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="t1">
			<h1 class="center">Helpful</h1>
			<p>I would consider myself to be a helpful person. I believe that you should treat others the way 			that you want to be treated. Hence, if there is anyone at home or school who needs help and I can 			provide it, I will happily provide assistance.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="t1">
			<h1 class="center">Perfectionist</h1>
			<p>I am a perfectionist. I am unsure if this is considered a negative or positive trait. Either 			way, for me I try to make everything I attempt my version of perfect. If I am doing an assignment 			or task, I will not finish or stop doing it until its pefect. I will redo it over and over again 			if it is not how I want it to be.</p>

			<p>“The past can hurt, but the way I see it you can either run from it, or learn from it.” – 				Rafiki, The Lion King.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="quote2">
			<p>Rafiki is a tall, long-limbed, and skinny male mandrill. He served as the Royal Mjuzi of the 			Pride Lands. He is eccentric and high-enegry. He has a light-hearted personality. He tends to 				laugh in serious serious situation but he is always there to lend a helping hand.<br><br>Even 				since I was a child I loved rafiki. When I was just a child, he was just a funny monkey. However, 			as I grew up and watched his actions and carefully listen to his words, I realized that many 				things that he talks about are valuable life lessons. In addition to his wise words, Rafiki is an 			amazing character. He is always there when the characters in the movie are about to give up and 			need a guiding hand.</p>
